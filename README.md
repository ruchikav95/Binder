## Concept
Binder is a platform for students to share textbooks, notes and study material with other students. 

## Motivation
* Rising textbook prices make it difficult for students to afford to buy textbooks.
* Students are becoming environmentally conscious. Participating in a book exchanges saves on ink and leaves a smaller environmental footprint than printing a book.

## How we built it
We built this project using MERN Stack (MySQL, Express, React/Redux, NodeJS).

## Technology & Packages

* Redux
* React-Redux
* Bootstrap
* Node.js
* Express
* MySQL
* Sequelize
* Ant Design
* Bcrypt
* Moment

## Starting the App Locally
* Start by installing running: npm install

### Configuration
* Open config/localhost.js - Set your custom configuration for MySql server
* Open frontend/src/config/localhost.js - Set your custom configs

### Resetting DB
* Create DB according to the Db_name in /config/localhost.js
* Run npm run db:reset:localhost - This command will drop all the database tables.
* Run npm start after running the above two commands

### Frontend
* After completing the above step, run npm start. Your app should now be running on http://localhost:8080.
