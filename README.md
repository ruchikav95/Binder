# Binder 

## Concept
Binder is a platform for students to share textbooks, notes and study material with other students. 

## Motivation
* Rising textbook prices make it difficult for students to afford to buy textbooks.
* Students are becoming environmentally conscious. Participating in a book exchanges saves on ink and leaves a smaller environmental footprint than printing a book.
